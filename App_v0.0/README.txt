This is an application designed by Deadlord of <Nocuous> on US-Skeram, and uses theoretically exact calculation of DPS for optimal warlock play in WoW Classic.

This goes beyond a typical calculation focused only on the average DPS value, and accounts for the actual probability of doing more than some estimated value. This option is controlled via the slider at the bottom right, and is accounted for within the mathematics as the desired percentile on the predicted DPS distribution. For example, some individuals may prefer to maximize the highest possible DPS obtainable by taking this parameter to the extreme (c -> 0), whereas some may want to be reliable across all fights and weekly resets (c -> 1).

The main goal is to visualize and understand the impact various buffs/consumes/gear have on total DPS.

As of version 1.0, the app does not account for talents, pets, or DoT rotations. It also does not include damage multipliers such as shadow weaving, demo sac, or DMF.

Future versions will include not only these, but will also allow the user to optimize gear choices according to damage probability preferences.
